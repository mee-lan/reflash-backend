 * The Scheduler — the core of the Anki algorithm.

 * A scheduler supports two main operations:
 *   1. {@link #getCard()}      — returns the next card to review.
 *   2. {@link #answerCard}     — updates a card after the user answers
 *                                 (ease: 0=Again, 1=Hard, 2=Good, 3=Easy).
 *
 * Each {@link Deck} owns one Scheduler instance. The scheduler holds a
 * back-reference to its deck so it can access the card list and, through
 * the deck's parent {@link StudyClass}, the collection creation timestamp
 * required for day-offset calculations.
